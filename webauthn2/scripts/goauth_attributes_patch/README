Note: if your database was built with a version of webauthn that was checked in
to github after December 18, 2015, you do NOT need this patch.

The original problem was that the initial implementation of the goauth attribute
(group) provider didn't create the attribute tables in the database. If your
database has a table called webauthn2_goauth.attribute, you don't need
this patch.

If you do need it, run goauth_attributes_patch.sql on your database.

Again, if your database was created with:
https://github.com/informatics-isi-edu/webauthn/commit/1244d2d6de8d7fe8145a29c89538fe21e4bcf4c2
or later, then you don't need this patch.
