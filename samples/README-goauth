Steps to configure a webauthn2 provider to use GOAuth:

1. Click on the "sign up" link at https://www.globus.org to create a
GOAuth account for the service.

2. Get the GOAuth admins to add your server name and newly-created username to the whitelist.

3. Make a copy of the go_config.yml file in this directory. Change the
values for "client" and "client_secret" to the username and password,
respectively, of the account you created in step 1.

4. Install the go_config.yml file. By default, it lives in
"/usr/local/etc/goauth/go_config.yml"; that can be overridden by
changing the "goauth_config_file" webauthn parameter.

5. Make sure your webauthn config parameters include oauth2 section
from the webauth2_config.sample file (the goauth provider inherits
some of these values). You don't need to include any of the goauth_*
entries unless you want to override them.

6. Set the "clients_provider" and "preauth_provider" webauthn2 config parameters to "goauth".

7. Set the "database_schema" webauthn2 config provider to "webauthn2_goauth".
