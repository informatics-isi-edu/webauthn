Overview
---------------------------

Our approach to software installation and packaging is to assume a
native packaged version is the preferrable means of getting software
onto an end-user system.  The experience should be roughly:

  1. install dependencies via native package tool

  2. install webauthn2 package

  3. install/deploy some application that uses webauthn2

The first two steps might be merged with a smarter native
package/repository tool.

Because webauthn2 is just a library used by other applications and
services, there is no "deployment" step for the library itself.
Instead, the dependent software must import webauthn2, provide a set
of configuration values, instantiate a Manager object, and run the
Manager.deploy() method if using any database providers.


Makefile driven installation
----------------------------

The Makefile is a developer or packager tool to help create the proper
file layout on disk as a prerequisite to packaging, testing, etc.


Logical Installation Layout
----------------------------

${PYTHONLIBDIR}/site-packages/webauthn2/
  -- Python module

${SHARE}/webauthn2/webauthn2_config.json
  -- Example configuration input

${VARLIB}/webauthn2/...
  -- predeploy.rXYZ marker used only by Makefile installations


RHEL/CentOS Layout and Issues
----------------------------

-- distribute our own web.py package?
   -- web.py prerequisite not available in standard repos for CentOS 6.x
   -- web.py 0.32 exists on Fedora <=16 and CentOS 5.x as python-webpy RPM
   -- web.py 0.36 exists on Fedora >=17
   -- upstream web.py 0.36 has a bug that needs patching

-- SELinux needs some booleans set to allow our functions in a web service
   -- database access from WSGI app
   -- access to daemon home directory for default JSON config input
   -- the exact booleans vary between releases


CentOS 6.x:

  PYTHONLIBDIR=/usr/lib/python2.6
  SHARE=/usr/share
  VARLIB=/var/lib
