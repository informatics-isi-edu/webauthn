Overview
---------------------------

Our approach to software installation and packaging is to assume a
native packaged version is the preferrable means of getting software
onto an end-user system.  The experience should be roughly:

  1. install dependencies via native package tool

  2. install webauthn2 package

  3. configure and deploy webauthn2

  4. install some application that uses webauthn2

The first two steps might be merged with a smarter native
package/repository tool.


Makefile driven installation
----------------------------

The Makefile is a developer or packager tool to help create the proper
file layout on disk as a prerequisite to packaging, testing, etc.


Logical Installation Layout
----------------------------

${PYTHONLIBDIR}/site-packages/webauthn2/
  - Python module

${BINDIR}/

${SHARE}/webauthn2/webauthn2_config.json
  - Example configuration input


RHEL/CentOS Layout and Issues
----------------------------

-- distribute our own web.py package?
   -- web.py prerequisite not available in standard repos for CentOS 6.x
   -- web.py 0.32 exists on Fedora <=16 and CentOS 5.x as python-webpy RPM
   -- web.py 0.36 exists on Fedora >=17
   -- upstream web.py 0.36 has a bug that needs patching

-- SELinux needs some booleans set to allow our functions in a web service
   -- database access from WSGI app
   -- access to daemon home directory for default JSON config input
   -- the exact booleans vary between releases
